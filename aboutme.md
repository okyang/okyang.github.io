# ğŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Owen

I'm a ğŸ’» software engineer, a ğŸ›  maker, and a ğŸŒ± environmentalist.

I graduated from the University of California, Irvine Class of 2020 with a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering. I like projects that intersect with IoT and sustainability.

In this blog, I attempt to share some of my projects that hopefully everyone can make as well!
