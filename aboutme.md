# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Owen

I'm a ðŸ’» software engineer, a ðŸ›  maker, and a ðŸŒ± environmentalist.

I graduated from the University of California, Irvine Class of 2020 with a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering. I wasn't always optimistic about protecting the environment, but at university and beyond I learned so many ways to do your part. Because of this, I really like working on engineering projects that are environmental related.

In this blog, I attempt to share some of my projects that hopefully everyone can make as well! I also like to have fun and build some non-environmental related projects as well.
