title: AQI monitoring with Adafruit IO
---
Air Quality Index (AQI) uses pollutants such as Particulate Matter 2.5 microns (PM2.5) to indicate air quality. This is a topic that I have been interested in for quite a while as PM2.5 is an important indicator of air pollution. It is invisible, yet it can cause serious health effects. For any type of air quality research, PM2.5 is one of the most important metrics to use. I set this project up in my own room to notify me if the air quality gets particularly bad based on the following [scale](https://aqicn.org/scale/). I will be using [Adafruit IO](https://io.adafruit.com/) to serve and manage data and the [PM2.5 Air Quality Sensor and Breadboard Adapter Kit - PMS5003](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3686) to get actual PM2.5 readings.
