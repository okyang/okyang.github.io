title: PIR Activated Cam
---
This project records videos whenever there is any motion detected. This could be used as a security camera for your snacks, a backyard wildlife monitor, and more. My Raspberry Pi had some issues with its GPIO pins and I also learned that some specific sensors do not work well with the Pi. So I decided this was the perfect opportunity to also learn how to use Nanpy, which allows the Raspberry Pi to use an Arduino's GPIO pins.
