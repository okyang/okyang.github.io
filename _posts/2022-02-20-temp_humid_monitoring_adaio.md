title: Temperature and Humidity Monitoring with Adafruit IO
---
This project shows you how to send temperature and humidity telemetry to Adafruit IO using the LYWSD03MMC and a Raspberry Pi. Using Bluetooth communication we find the broadcast of the LYWSD03MMC and communicate its readings to Adafruit IO. It's a cute little temperature and humidity sensor with LCD display as pictured below (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
