title: Operation Shock
---

I was watching a YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kml6bc-URu4) about Allen Pan from Sufficiently Advanced, building the game operation with it twist. It shocks you every-time you mess up. I thought it would be fun to build my own version of it, so here we go. Operation is very common board game where a player performs "operation" using a metal tweezer to try to take out objects from a cardboard cutout of a person (see image below). However, if your tweezer touches the board, you lose!

In Allen Pan's video, he added his own twist to the game by including a TENS unit. This TENS unit would "shock" or electrically stimulate your muscle if your tweezers touches the board. I was inspired by that video to try to make my own version of it. It was a lot of fun making it and even more fun to play with friends. I think it also has a great team bonding aspect to it because if one person messes up, the other person who is hooked up to the TENS unit also gets shocked!
