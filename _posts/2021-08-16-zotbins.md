ZotBins is system of Smart Waste Bins with a Web-based User Interface to collect real-time waste data. Through IoT, ZotBins is able to use waste data to encourage zero waste practices from a behavioral approach while also demonstrating use of quantifiable data to improve waste management systems holistically.

I started this project in 2017 during my first year at UCI as hackathon project. Since then, the project has grown from 4 members to an entire undergraduate research team of about 20 members (last I counted).

This is one of the longest and favorite projects I worked on at UCI. I really believe that having a smart waste metrics system such as ZotBins could really help communities reach zero waste.
