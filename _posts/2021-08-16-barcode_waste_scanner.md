title: Barcode Waste Sorter
---

Have you ever been in a situation where you have trash, but you don't know how you should throw it away? This app allows users to scan barcodes of certain items that they want to throw away and the app will return detailed instructions of how to properly dispose of it!

This project is more of a proof-of-concept work. I wanted to show that it was possible to use existing barcode systems on packaging to help people properly sort their waste. It was also my first attempt at doing some mobile-app development using Flutter.

Flutter is a great cross-platform development kit. Some of the main advantages are its out of the box UI elements that you can use and also it's native runtime environment. It's pretty neat! There was a slight learning curve when using Dart, but it was easy to get used to since it is object oriented and there were plenty of great examples.
