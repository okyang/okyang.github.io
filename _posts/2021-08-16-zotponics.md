ZotPonics is a Smart and Automated Hydroponics system for Sustainable Agriculture. With a system of sensors, pumps, lights, and other peripherials that are controlled by a mobile-based user-interface where people can grow tasty vegetables or any plants right from the comfort of their own home. It is 85% more water efficient than traditional agriculture and sustainable.

This project was created during my 4th year at UCI and combined my passion for gardening and robotics. It was really fun to create a working hydroponics project.
