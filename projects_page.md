## ZotBins Community Edition

A continuation of the ZotBins Project, called ZotBins Community Edition (ZBCE), an open-source project. I further work with the new ZotBins team to help expand the concept of ZotBins where any city, business, university, classroom, or home could implement a smart waste metrics system.
